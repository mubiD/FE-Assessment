    - Disclaimer (provided)
5. Logo (provided)

## Bugs and their fixes:

1. Responsive HTML campaign mailer
2. Advertise the model in Activity 1
3. Structural elements:
    - Header image
    - Body copy
    - A button linking to BMW's website

4. No templates allowed

## Bugs and their fixes:
1. Responsiveness could be improved

## Improvements and their implementations:

2. UI of buttons could be optimized with custom CSS

## Activity Three:

## Requirements:
1. Recreate the BMW website landing page 
2. Use Bootstrap for responsiveness
3. Only 3 items in the menu
4. Make "Electric" a flyout
5. Include one row of electric models
6. Give them a hover state

## Bugs and their fixes:
1. Landing page needs a body and footer section
2. Row of electric models should have a hover state. This is partially implemented using JQuery - however commented out since it is a work in progress
3. Font sizes should adjust more smoothly as screen size changes. This can be improved using CSS media queries

## Improvements and their implementations:
1. Add the body and footer
2. Complete the hover state of the electric model cards on flyout
